# Exploring-SHVN-Dataset
Image Classification 
For the capstone project, I used the SVHN dataset. This is an image dataset of over 600,000 digit images in
all, and is a harder dataset than MNIST as the numbers appear in the context of natural scene images. SVHN is
obtained from house numbers in Google Street View images.

Unsupervised Feature Learning". NIPS Workshop on Deep Learning and Unsupervised Feature Learning,
2011.
My goal was to develop an end-to-end workflow for building, training, validating, evaluating and saving a neural
network that classifies a real-world image into one of ten classes.


# German to English Translator
For the capstone project, i used  a language dataset from http://www.manythings.org/anki/ to build a neural translation model. This dataset consists of over 200,000 pairs of sentences in English and German. In order to make the training quicker, i restricted to the dataset to 20,000 pairs. Feel free to change this if you wish - the size of the dataset used is not part of the grading rubric.

The main goal is to develop a neural translation model from English to German, making use of a pre-trained English word embedding module.
